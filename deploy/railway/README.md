# Deploy an Omnigraph cookbook on Railway

One-click deploys of any cookbook in this repo against a managed
S3-compatible bucket on [Railway](https://railway.com). No AWS account
needed; Railway provisions the storage, generates the bearer tokens, and
converges the cookbook's cluster config on first boot.

## What you get

| Piece                  | Where it runs                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `omnigraph-server`     | Single Railway service (this repo's `deploy/railway/Dockerfile`)         |
| Storage                | Railway Bucket — first-party S3, unlimited free S3 ops + bucket egress   |
| Cluster config         | The bundled cookbook's directory (`cluster.yaml` + schema + stored queries + policies), selected via `OMNIGRAPH_COOKBOOK` and converged by `omnigraph cluster apply` at deploy time |
| Auth (3 actors)        | `act-admin` / `act-writer` / `act-reader` bearer tokens auto-generated at deploy |
| Authz                  | Cedar policy bundles applied as cluster state (template bundles injected for cookbooks without their own) |
| Public HTTPS endpoint  | Railway-managed `*.up.railway.app` domain with auto-SSL                  |

The template is **schema-only**: it applies the cookbook's cluster config
(schema + stored queries + policies) and then stops. The graph starts
empty and ready to receive your real data via the `omnigraph` CLI or the
HTTP API. Demo `seed.jsonl` files from the cookbooks are not auto-loaded.

Total cost on Railway Hobby: ~$0.015/GB-month for stored data + the
service's compute. No volumes attached — all state lives in the Bucket.
Bucket egress and S3 API operations are free and unlimited, but note that
*uploads from the service to the Bucket* (every `cluster apply` / `load` /
`change`) count as **service egress** and are billed at Railway's standard
public egress rate — Buckets are not on the private network.

## Deploy

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/new/template/TEMPLATE_CODE?utm_medium=integration&utm_source=button&utm_campaign=omnigraph)

At deploy time, pick the cookbook via the `OMNIGRAPH_COOKBOOK` variable —
one of `industry-intel` (default), `pharma-intel`, `second-brain`,
`vc-os`, or `dev-graph`. The cookbook cluster configs are bundled in the
image; the deploy converges the one you pick onto the Bucket and serves
its graph at `/graphs/<id>/…`.

| Cookbook | `OMNIGRAPH_COOKBOOK` | Graph id |
|---|---|---|
| AI/ML industry intelligence (SPIKE) | `industry-intel` | `spike` |
| Pharma competitive intelligence | `pharma-intel` | `pharma` |
| Personal life automation | `second-brain` | `brain` |
| Venture-capital operating system | `vc-os` | `vcos` |
| Software-development knowledge graph | `dev-graph` | `dev` |

To deploy your **own** schema, fork this repo, add a cookbook directory
(`cluster.yaml` + `schema.pg` + optional `queries/` and `policies/`), add
a `COPY` line for it in `deploy/railway/Dockerfile`, and point your
Railway service at the fork.

> # Make sure the service's region matches the Bucket region (railway scale)
> railway up --service omnigraph
> ```

## Service region — this is critical, not cosmetic

**You must place the service in the same region as the Bucket.** A Railway
service with no explicit region (`region: null`, the default) deploys to
the workspace's default region — which is almost never the Bucket's region.
Because `omnigraph-server` makes **many sequential S3 round-trips per
operation**, a cross-region service↔Bucket hop multiplies that RTT on every
read and write. Measured on a deliberately mismatched deploy (service on
default region, Bucket in `sjc`):

| Operation | Cross-region (mismatched) | In-region (expected) |
| --------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `/healthz` (no Bucket) | ~390 ms | ~390 ms |
| `snapshot` read | **~5.7 s** | sub-second |
| single-node write | **~46 s** | ~1 s |

So a mismatch isn't "a bit slower" — it makes the graph effectively
unusable for writes. The Bucket region is fixed at creation; set the
**service** region to match it (Railway dashboard → service **Settings →
Region**, or pin it in config-as-code via
[`multiRegionConfig`](https://docs.railway.com/config-as-code/reference#multi-region-configuration)
using the identifier from the table below). Verify after deploy that the
service's region matches the Bucket's.

Mind the two naming schemes: the **Bucket CLI** uses short codes
(`sjc` / `iad` / `ams` / `sin`), while the **service** region picker (and
config-as-code) uses the full identifiers. Match them up:

| Location               | Bucket code | Service identifier        |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| California, US West    | `sjc`       | `us-west2`                |
| Virginia, US East      | `iad`       | `us-east4-eqdc4a`         |
| Amsterdam, EU West     | `ams`       | `europe-west4-drams3a`    |
| Singapore, SE Asia     | `sin`       | `asia-southeast1-eqsg3a`  |

Because no Railway Volume is attached, changing the service region later
is zero-downtime — only volume-backed services incur migration downtime.

## Scaling and availability

**Keep this service at a single replica.** Railway's production-readiness
checklist recommends ≥2 replicas, but that assumes a stateless service.
`omnigraph-server` is a single-writer store backed by one shared Bucket
prefix, and Railway load-balances replicas randomly with no sticky
sessions — two replicas would race on the same S3 objects and can corrupt
the graph. Do **not** raise the replica count or add multi-region
replicas in the dashboard. Durability comes from Railway's Bucket storage
plus the `ON_FAILURE` restart policy; for point-in-time safety, run
`omnigraph export` / `snapshot` to a second location on a schedule, since
Buckets have no built-in snapshot/versioning.

## Required environment variables

The template configures these for you. Listed here so you understand
what each does (and to make manual deploys reproducible).

| Variable                              | Value at deploy                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OMNIGRAPH_COOKBOOK`                  | Which bundled cookbook cluster config to converge. Default `industry-intel`.             |
| `OMNIGRAPH_CLUSTER_URI`               | `s3://${{Bucket.BUCKET}}/cluster` — the cluster storage root; the server boots config-free from it |
| `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`                    | `${{Bucket.ENDPOINT}}` — read by Lance's `object_store`                                  |
| `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`                 | `${{Bucket.ENDPOINT}}` — read by the omnigraph S3 adapter (set both for cross-version safety) |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`                   | `${{Bucket.ACCESS_KEY_ID}}`                                                              |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`               | `${{Bucket.SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}`                                                          |
| `AWS_REGION`                          | `${{Bucket.REGION}}`                                                                     |
| `OMNIGRAPH_SERVER_BEARER_TOKENS_JSON` | `{"act-admin":"${{secret(48)}}","act-writer":"${{secret(48)}}","act-reader":"${{secret(48)}}"}` — keys are actor ids referenced by every bundled policy |

### Embeddings

Four of the five cookbooks (`industry-intel`, `second-brain`, `vc-os`,
`dev-graph`) have schemas with `Vector(...) @embed("...")` fields. The
template does not configure an embedding provider or populate those vectors.

Practical consequences:

- Structural queries and full-text search work without an embedding provider.
- To enable vector queries, fork the cookbook, declare one named provider and
  bind it to the graph in `cluster.yaml`, then supply that provider's secret to
  the server. Its model must match the model used for stored vectors.
- `omnigraph embed` is an offline file-to-file pipeline; it never connects to
  or mutates the deployed graph. Prepare embedded JSONL locally, then load it
  through the authenticated server. `--reembed-all` replaces matching vectors
  in the output file, not in a live graph.
- `pharma-intel` has no `@embed` fields and never needs the key.

`${{Bucket.*}}` and `${{secret(N)}}` are Railway's reference-variable
and template-function syntax — they resolve at deploy time without
appearing in build logs.

## Get your tokens

After the first deploy:

1. Open the omnigraph service in the Railway dashboard.
2. Go to the **Variables** tab.
3. Find `OMNIGRAPH_SERVER_BEARER_TOKENS_JSON`. Railway shows the
   resolved JSON; copy the three tokens.

Then call the server (multi-graph routes — the graph id comes from the
cookbook table above):

```bash
ENDPOINT="https://$YOUR_SERVICE.up.railway.app"
TOKEN="$ADMIN_TOKEN_FROM_VARS"

curl -fsS "$ENDPOINT/healthz" | jq .
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$ENDPOINT/graphs" | jq .
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$ENDPOINT/graphs/spike/snapshot?branch=main" | jq '.tables[] | select(.row_count > 0)'
```

## Authorization model

Policy is **applied cluster state** in OmniGraph 0.10, not a server flag.
Cookbooks without their own `policies:` get the template bundles
(`deploy/railway/config/*.railway.yaml`), which define three roles wired
to the token JSON's actor ids:

| Actor        | Can do                                                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `act-admin`  | Everything: stored queries, `read`, `export`, `change`, `schema_apply`, `branch_*`, `GET /graphs` |
| `act-writer` | Stored queries, `read`, `export`, `change` on any branch; `branch_create` against unprotected branches |
| `act-reader` | Stored read queries, `read`, `export` on any branch                          |

`main` is protected — only `act-admin` can target it with
`branch_create` or run `schema_apply` / `branch_delete` / `branch_merge`
anywhere. `GET /graphs` (registry enumeration) is a server-scoped action
granted to admins by the cluster-bound bundle.

`industry-intel` ships its own policy bundles but accepts the same three
generated actors: admin and writer can write, while reader is read-only.
Existing `act-analyst` tokens remain a backwards-compatible writer alias.

Bearer tokens are SHA-256 hashed on server startup; the plaintext lives
only in the Railway-encrypted env var, not in process memory. Constant-
time comparison. The server refuses to boot with no tokens configured
unless `--unauthenticated` is passed explicitly.

## Rotation

Open the Variables tab → click the regenerate icon on a specific
sub-field of `OMNIGRAPH_SERVER_BEARER_TOKENS_JSON`, or edit the JSON
inline. Click **Redeploy** to pick up the change.

## Customizing the policy

Policy bundles are cluster state, converged by `cluster apply` on every
deploy. For a different role/group structure:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Edit `deploy/railway/config/policy.railway.yaml` (cookbooks with their
   own `policies/` directory: edit those instead).
3. Validate locally: `omnigraph cluster validate --config <cookbook-dir>`
   (for the template bundles, run a local init simulation or validate the
   assembled config).
4. Push the fork and point your Railway service at it; the next deploy's
   `cluster apply` converges the change. Policy YAML validates
   strictly — unknown fields are errors, one bundle owns each scope, and
   server-scoped actions (`graph_list`) cannot carry branch scopes.

## Re-deploy and schema changes

The `preDeployCommand` runs `omnigraph-railway-init.sh` between build and
start on every deploy. The script assembles the cookbook's cluster config,
points `storage:` at `OMNIGRAPH_CLUSTER_URI`, and runs
`cluster validate` → `cluster import` (fresh Bucket only) →
`cluster apply`. Apply is declarative and convergent:

- **Fresh Bucket** → initializes the ledger, creates the graph, applies
  schema, stored queries, and policies.
- **Existing cluster** → converges to the declared state; an unchanged
  config is a no-op (`no changes … converged: true`). No data loss across
  re-deploys.

Schema changes ship the same way: edit the cookbook's `schema.pg` in your
fork and redeploy — `cluster apply` plans and applies the migration.
Cluster-managed graphs **refuse** direct `omnigraph schema apply`; the
cluster config is the single owner of the schema.

## Upgrading the engine (`OMNIGRAPH_REF` bumps)

The image is pinned to v0.10.0. Upgrade the CLI, server, and client
integrations together; never run mixed release fleets against one graph.

The v0.9→v0.10 upgrade keeps graph format v6, so entities, branches, and
history do not need export/import. It does move from Lance 9 to Lance 11 and
changes the full-text analyzer:

1. Stop application traffic and inventory every live branch that uses
   full-text search.
2. Preserve a verified backup of the entire cluster root, deployment bundle,
   and configuration. A branch export is not a rollback backup.
3. Stop all old servers, writers, and maintenance jobs. Build or pull the
   v0.10 image and use its CLI in an in-region one-off maintenance run; keep
   the serving service stopped.
4. Rebuild each live search branch directly against its derived graph root:

   ```bash
   omnigraph rebuild-full-text-indexes \
     s3://<bucket>/<cluster>/graphs/<graph-id>.omni \
     --branch main --as operator --json
   ```

5. Verify representative searches and entity counts on every rebuilt branch,
   then deploy/start only the v0.10 fleet. Historical snapshots are retained
   but are not rewritten and may refuse full-text search.

Rollback means restoring the whole pre-upgrade backup with the old fleet, not
pointing v0.9 at the upgraded store. If v0.10 has persisted `external_blobs`
cluster state, follow the engine's cluster rollback procedure as well.

For a future graph-format change, follow that release's engine upgrade guide;
do not infer an export/rebuild procedure from this v0.9→v0.10 case.
The complete v0.10 procedure and refusal cases live in the engine's
[upgrade guide](https://github.com/ModernRelay/omnigraph/blob/v0.10.0/docs/user/operations/upgrade.md#v09-to-v010).

Write preflight remains strict: keyed `append`/`merge` operations admit at
most 8,192 rows and 32 MiB of Arrow data per table. `overwrite` escapes the row
ceiling, but **not** the 32 MiB strict-input preflight, so chunk a larger
replacement. A failed load publishes no commit.

## Loading data

The deploy is schema-only; you fill the graph yourself. Two paths:

- **Through the server: `omnigraph load` or `mutate` over HTTPS** with a
  writer/admin bearer token. `load` works against a served
  remote too (`--server` + `--graph`); the server performs the writes in
  its own region, so it's version-safe and avoids cross-network S3. Keyed
  loads (`--mode merge`/`append`) are capped at 8,192 rows / 32 MiB per
  table per request. `overwrite` removes the row ceiling but still has the
  32 MiB per-table preflight, so chunk larger imports.
- **Direct to the Bucket (`omnigraph load s3://…/graphs/<id>.omni`):
  version-pinned and in-region only.** Two hazards:
  1. **Version skew fails the load.** Your local CLI must match the
     deployed `OMNIGRAPH_REF`. The storage-format gate is enforced at
     open, in both directions, before anything is written. Check up
     front: `omnigraph version` prints the binary's format version (the
     `internal-schema` line) and `omnigraph snapshot` / `GET /healthz`
     report the graph's.
  2. **Run it in-region.** A direct load from a laptop across the world to
     the Bucket pays the cross-region RTT on every one of its many
     sequential S3 calls — minutes-to-hours for a few hundred rows. Run
     the loader from the Bucket's region (or go through the server).

## Switching cookbooks

`OMNIGRAPH_COOKBOOK` selects the cluster config that `cluster apply`
converges. Changing it against an existing cluster does **not** remove the
previous cookbook's graph — apply is additive/convergent per declared
resource, and removing graphs is approval-gated by design. To switch a
running service to a different cookbook cleanly, destroy the Bucket
(`railway bucket -b graph-storage delete` — the bucket is named with the
global `-b/--bucket` flag, not a positional) and redeploy; the next deploy
re-creates the cluster from the newly selected cookbook.

## Local validation

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -f deploy/railway/Dockerfile -t omnigraph-railway:test .

# Verify the binaries and the bundled cookbook configs landed
docker run --rm omnigraph-railway:test omnigraph version
docker run --rm omnigraph-railway:test ls /opt/cookbooks

# Run the full preDeploy + serve flow against a local RustFS
docker run --rm \
  -e OMNIGRAPH_COOKBOOK=industry-intel \
  -e OMNIGRAPH_CLUSTER_URI=s3://omnigraph-local/railway-test \
  -e AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3=http://host.docker.internal:9000 \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=rustfsadmin \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=rustfsadmin \
  -e AWS_REGION=us-east-1 \
  -e AWS_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true \
  -e AWS_ALLOW_HTTP=true \
  omnigraph-railway:test \
  sh -c '/usr/local/bin/omnigraph-railway-init.sh'
```

## Pinning + maintenance

The Dockerfile pins the OmniGraph engine to a specific tag via
`ARG OMNIGRAPH_REF=v0.10.0`. Bump that on every OmniGraph release that
changes server behavior, the policy schema, or the CLI surface — and if
the release changes the storage format, follow
[Upgrading the engine](#upgrading-the-engine-omnigraph_ref-bumps) above:
existing graphs must be rebuilt or the next deploy fails. The cookbook
cluster configs **are** baked into the image (a cluster config is a
directory, not one fetchable file), so cookbook changes ship with a
rebuild — which Railway does automatically on every deploy from the repo.

Because the service builds from this GitHub repo (not a prebuilt image),
merges to `main` surface an update PR to everyone who deployed the
template — keep a changelog and call out breaking changes (e.g. an
`OMNIGRAPH_REF` bump) so deployers know what they're accepting.

## Files

```

`railway.toml` lives at the repo root because Railway reads its config from a service's root directory by default; everything else stays under `deploy/railway/` for tidiness.
