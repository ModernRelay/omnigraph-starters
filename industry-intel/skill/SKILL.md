# SPIKE Cookbook Bootstrap

This skill takes a user from zero to a populated, queryable SPIKE graph. Two paths:

- **Demo** — use the existing `industry-intel` cookbook (AI/ML signals as of early 2026). Good for demos, exploration, and understanding what SPIKE looks like populated.
- **Custom** — set up a new domain (biotech, crypto, fintech, geopolitics, etc.). Takes ~30–60 minutes including initial research and user review.

**Prerequisites:**

1. OmniGraph CLI and server v0.10.0.

2. The `omnigraph-cookbooks` repo cloned somewhere on disk. Ask the user where (or default to the current directory):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ModernRelay/omnigraph-cookbooks.git
   ```
   Record the absolute path to the clone — the **Demo** path runs from `<clone>/industry-intel/`, the **Custom** path runs from `<clone>/` (repo root) so it can copy `industry-intel/` as a template.

## Step 0: Pre-flight checks

Before either path, run these checks (and act on the results):

```bash
# Ensure the exact supported CLI is on PATH
command -v omnigraph >/dev/null || { echo "omnigraph not found — install via homebrew or the install script"; exit 1; }

# Require v0.10.0; upgrade CLI and server together.
test "$(omnigraph --version)" = "omnigraph 0.10.0" || { echo "this skill requires omnigraph 0.10.0"; exit 1; }
omnigraph version
```

The default (cluster-first) path needs **no RustFS, no credentials, no
.env.omni** — graphs live at local derived roots created by `cluster apply`.
RustFS checks and `.env.omni` only matter for the optional S3 alternative (see
the cookbook READMEs). A 0.9 graph needs the engine's coordinated 0.9→0.10
upgrade procedure and full-text-index rebuild before this skill operates it.

**If `:8080` returns `200` from a server pointed at a different repo** (the bootstrap script auto-starts one), stop it before starting yours, or rebind to a free port via `omnigraph-server --bind 127.0.0.1:8090`.

For the optional local S3 path only, follow the engine deployment guide and
source all seven `AWS_*` variables from the gitignored `.env.omni`; the default
filesystem path ignores that file.

## Step 1: Ask the user which path

Ask the user (use whatever structured-question primitive your runtime offers, or a plain prompt):

> Do you want to:
> - **Demo** — set up the AI industry intel demo (5 patterns, 15 signals, ~110 nodes, ready to query in ~30 seconds)
> - **Custom** — set up a graph for a new domain (I'll ask about your domain + sources, adapt the schema, research real seed data, and wire it up)

Branch based on the answer.

## Path A: Demo Setup

Quick — clone, converge, load. The cookbook ships a `cluster.yaml` declaring
the graph, schema, and all stored queries; `cluster apply` creates the graph.

See [`references/demo-setup.md`](references/demo-setup.md) for the full command list. Summary:

```bash
cd <path-to-clone>/omnigraph-cookbooks/industry-intel
# First merge omnigraph-config.example.yaml's servers/defaults/aliases into
# ~/.omnigraph/config.yaml; login stores the token separately.
omnigraph cluster import --config .
omnigraph cluster apply  --config . --as <you>     # creates graphs/spike.omni + publishes queries
omnigraph load --data seed.jsonl --mode overwrite graphs/spike.omni
# Serve with the cookbook policy, then authenticate the CLI:
OMNIGRAPH_SERVER_BEARER_TOKENS_JSON='{"act-admin":"local-admin-token","act-writer":"local-writer-token","act-reader":"local-reader-token"}' \
  omnigraph-server --cluster . --bind 127.0.0.1:8080 &
printf '%s' 'local-reader-token' | omnigraph login local
omnigraph alias patterns disruption    # CLI alias sugar
```

After this, point the user at the `omnigraph` skill (`npx skills add ModernRelay/omnigraph@omnigraph`) for day-to-day operations.

## Path B: Custom Domain Setup

Six phases, in order. Don't skip ahead — each phase's output feeds the next.

### Phase 1 — Domain identification

Ask the user which domain they want to track. Present these as options:

- Biotech
- Fintech
- Manufacturing
- Crypto / web3
- Geopolitics
- Other (user specifies)

Then narrow:
- Scope: "all of X" or "only Y within X"?
- Global or regional?

Capture a **project slug** for the new cookbook: `bio-intel`, `crypto-intel`, `geo-intel`, etc. This becomes the folder name and the repo prefix (`s3://omnigraph-local/repos/<slug>`).

### Phase 2 — Key questions

Ask each in turn (multi-select where noted). See [`references/custom-domain.md`](references/custom-domain.md) for full phrasing and option lists.

- **Actors to track** (multi-select): companies, labs, regulators, individuals, protocols, investors
- **Time horizon**: recent only (3mo), medium (12mo), or full historical
- **Update cadence**: daily, weekly, monthly, ad-hoc
- **Primary consumer**: human analysts, internal dashboard, AI agents, mixed

### Phase 3 — Sources (most important)

Sources are the lifeblood of a SPIKE graph. The quality of the output is bounded by the quality of the sources. Spend time here.

Ask in order (see [`references/custom-domain.md`](references/custom-domain.md) for exact wording):

1. **Primary reading list** — newsletters, blogs, publications the user already reads (free-form, 5–15 entries)
2. **Priority analysts / experts** — 3–10 people whose takes should be first-class entities
3. **Regulatory / authoritative sources** — governmental, self-regulatory (FDA, SEC, IMF, etc.)
4. **Academic / primary sources** — journals, preprint servers, research aggregators
5. **Social / community** — X accounts, podcasts, forums

### Phase 4 — Confirm summary

Before making changes, echo what you captured back to the user:

- Domain + scope + project slug
- Actor types to track
- Horizon + cadence + consumer
- Source list (grouped by category)

Write this to `<slug>/setup-notes.md` in the new cookbook folder. Confirming now is cheap; rework later isn't.

### Phase 5 — Adapt the schema

From the **repo root** (`<clone>/`), copy `industry-intel/` as a template into `<slug>/`:

```bash
cd <clone>          # repo root, parent of industry-intel/
cp -r industry-intel <slug>
rm <slug>/seed.jsonl    # regenerated in Phase 6
```

Update in `<slug>/schema.pg`:

- `Element.kind` enum — replace with domain-appropriate kinds
- `Signal.domain` / `Element.domain` enum — replace with domain slices
- `Company.type` enum — match the ecosystem
- `SourceEntity.type` enum — match how sources publish
- `ArtifactType` enum — include domain-relevant formats
- Kind-specific Element properties (biotech wants `phase`, `moa`; crypto wants `chain`, `token_symbol`; etc.)

Update in `<slug>/cluster.yaml`:

- `metadata.name` → domain-appropriate name
- the `graphs:` entry id → `<slug>` (its derived root becomes `graphs/<slug>.omni`)

Update `<slug>/omnigraph-config.example.yaml` too: change `default_graph` and
every alias `graph:` from `spike` to `<slug>`, and adjust aliases if query names
changed. Before verification, merge its `servers`, `defaults`, and `aliases`
into `~/.omnigraph/config.yaml`.

**Pattern.kind** (`challenge`, `disruption`, `dynamic`) is usually domain-agnostic. Don't change it unless the user has strong reasons.

See [`references/schema-adaptation.md`](references/schema-adaptation.md) for the full keep-vs-change rules. See [`references/domain-examples.md`](references/domain-examples.md) for worked examples across biotech, crypto, fintech, geopolitics.

After editing:

```bash
cd <slug>
omnigraph lint --schema schema.pg --query queries/signals.gq
```

Fix any lint errors before moving on.

### Phase 6 — Research, seed, init, load

Use web research to build real seed content. **Do not fabricate signals or dates.** See [`references/research.md`](references/research.md) for the workflow. High-level:

1. For each source from Phase 3, pull recent items (WebFetch / WebSearch)
2. Extract candidate signals (dated, URL-backed, specific)
3. Cluster into 3–5 patterns (recurring themes)
4. For each pattern, identify the Elements, Companies, Experts mentioned
5. Write `<slug>/seed.md` (tabular, human-readable) — **present this to the user for review before generating JSONL**
6. Generate `<slug>/seed.jsonl` from the confirmed seed.md. **Every `slug`
   must appear exactly once in the file** — since omnigraph 0.8.0 a `@key`
   repeated within one load batch fails the whole load (nothing is
   partially applied); dedupe and re-run if it does. Duplicate edge rows
   on `@unique(src)` or `@unique(src,dst)` edges fail the same way.
7. From `<clone>/<slug>/`, converge the cluster, load, then start the server
   (the `cluster.yaml` — copied from industry-intel and re-slugged — declares
   the graph, schema, and queries):

```bash
cd <clone>/<slug>
omnigraph cluster import --config .
omnigraph cluster plan   --config .                # review what apply will do
omnigraph cluster apply  --config . --as <you>     # creates graphs/<slug>.omni
omnigraph load --data seed.jsonl --mode overwrite graphs/<slug>.omni
OMNIGRAPH_SERVER_BEARER_TOKENS_JSON='{"act-admin":"local-admin-token","act-writer":"local-writer-token","act-reader":"local-reader-token"}' \
  omnigraph-server --cluster . --bind 127.0.0.1:8080 &
printf '%s' 'local-reader-token' | omnigraph login local
```

8. Verify with a sample query (goes through the server):

```bash
omnigraph alias patterns <pattern-kind>
```

### Phase 7 — Hand-off

Tell the user:

- What got created: the cookbook folder (a **cluster directory** —
  `cluster.yaml` declares graph + schema + queries; the graph lives at
  `graphs/<slug>.omni`, created by apply), the seed counts
- How to query: CLI aliases (per-operator `~/.omnigraph/config.yaml`), or HTTP —
  every declared query is served at `POST /graphs/<slug>/queries/<name>`
- The day-2 loop: edit `.pg`/`.gq`/`cluster.yaml` → `cluster plan` →
  `cluster apply --as <you>` → restart the server
- To use the `omnigraph` skill for day-to-day ops (adding
  signals, schema evolution, branches; see its `references/cluster.md`)
