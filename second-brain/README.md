# Second Brain — Personal Life Ontology

A minimal-but-comprehensive Omnigraph cookbook for individuals. Built on [Omnigraph](https://github.com/ModernRelay/omnigraph).

This cookbook is opinionated for personal life: people, places, projects, notes, tasks, habits, media - plus the provenance layer needed to capture from any channel. **13 node types, 43 edge types**, designed to feel light when you start and scale up gracefully.

> For operating Omnigraph — schema authoring, queries, loading, branches, cluster ops, CLI — see the **omnigraph-best-practices** skill. This README covers only what's specific to Second Brain.
>
> No object store needed — this is a filesystem-backed cluster.

## What This Is

A graph schema for the things people actually want their second brain to answer:

- *Who haven't I talked to in a while that I want to?*
- *What did Sarah recommend that I haven't read yet?*
- *What do I still owe Theo?*
- *What's on my mind about parenting / work / health?*
- *Which projects are blocking which goals?*
- *Where do my principles, habits, and decisions actually connect?*

No SPIKE pattern layer — we deliberately skipped it. This is for individual life, not industry analysis. The strategy layer can come back as an extension if you want belief/decision tracking.

## Reference Seed: Alex Chen

The seed populates the life of a fictional 36-year-old senior product designer in Brooklyn — partner Maya, two kids, a side project, a half-marathon, a kitchen renovation, and a preschool decision in progress. All names, places, and dates are fabricated. See `seed.md` for the full layout.

**Totals:** 121 nodes across 12 types, 229 edges across 36 types. `Knows` and `RelatedToPerson` are stored bidirectionally — see `CLAUDE.md` for the load-discipline convention.

| Dimension | Count | Includes |
|---|---|---|
| People | 16 | Self, partner, 2 kids, parents + in-laws, sibling, 4 close friends, 3 colleagues, mentor |
| Organizations | 5 | Employer, partner's firm, side-project LLC, preschool, pediatrician |
| Places | 9 | Home, office, favorite restaurant, park, three out-of-town cities |
| Areas | 5 | Health, Career, Family, Learning, Creativity |
| Goals | 4 | Ship side project beta, run a half-marathon, read 24 books, save $30k |
| Projects | 6 | 4 active + 2 exploring |
| Habits | 5 | Morning pages, 3x weekly run, Sunday family dinner, read before bed, deep work block |
| Events | 12 | 7 past (Theo's birthday, Hannah's visit, Maya's promotion, etc.) + 5 upcoming |
| Notes | 21 | Principles (3), preferences (5), journal (2), insights (3), reflections (2), questions (2), and idea / decision / quote / dream |
| Tasks | 15 | next, waiting, someday, inbox — including `i-owe` and `they-owe` directions |
| Media | 12 | Books finished/want/consuming, podcasts, a documentary recommended by partner |
| Artifacts | 11 | Email, WhatsApp, iMessage, meeting notes, voice memo, calendar invite, web clip, journal — plus 2 derived |

## Schema Essentials

**Nodes (13):** Person · Organization · Place · Event · Note · Task · Project · Area · Goal · Habit · Media · Artifact · Chunk

**The enums that carry the lens:**

| Enum | Values |
|---|---|
| `Person.relation` | `self, family, partner, close-friend, friend, colleague, mentor, mentee, acquaintance, professional` |
| `Note.kind` | `idea, journal, reflection, insight, principle, preference, quote, dream, question, decision` |
| `Task.status` | `inbox, next, waiting, someday, done, cancelled` |
| `Task.direction` | `i-owe, they-owe, mutual` |
| `Task.context` | `phone, computer, errand, home, office, anywhere` |
| `Project.status` | `exploring, active, paused, completed, abandoned` |
| `Area.kind` | `health, career, finance, relationships, learning, creativity, community, spirituality, home, family, other` |
| `Habit.frequency` | `daily, weekly, monthly` |
| `Media.kind` | 13 values: book, article, movie, show, podcast, episode, album, paper, video, game, blog, newsletter, website |
| `Artifact.source` | 16 values: whatsapp, email, slack, telegram, imessage, sms, linkedin, instagram, x, calendar, web, manual, voice, notes-app, readwise, other |

**Edges that carry the work** (everything else is provenance or classification):

| Edge | Route | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Knows` | Person → Person | Friend, colleague, acquaintance — with context and since |
| `RelatedToPerson` | Person → Person | Family/partnership structure, with `relation` enum on the edge |
| `LivesIn` / `WorksAt` | Person → Place / Organization | The "where they are" data |
| `AttendedBy` / `HappenedAt` | Event → Person / Place | Who was there, where it happened |
| `EventForPerson` | Event → Person | Milestones affecting someone (e.g. their wedding) without them "attending" |
| `NoteAbout{Person,Project,Area,Place,Organization,Media}` | Note → world | What this note is about |
| `RelatedNote` | Note → Note | Zettelkasten-style atomic links |
| `HabitFromPrinciple` | Habit → Note | The principle (kind=principle) that motivated the habit |
| `Task.direction = i-owe/they-owe` + `TaskForPerson` | Task → Person | Relationship-debt tracking without a separate Commitment node |
| `MediaRecommendedBy` / `MediaAuthoredBy` | Media → Person | Who pointed you at this; who wrote it |
| `MentionsPerson` / `ArtifactFromPerson` | Artifact → Person | Provenance: who's named, who sent it |
| `DerivedFromArtifact` | Artifact → Artifact | AI/manual transforms with `activity` enum (transcribed, summarized, ocr, etc.) |
| `ChunkOf` | Chunk → Artifact | Embedding-driven semantic search |

**Key design choices:**

- **Slug prefix convention** is mandatory: `per-`, `org-`, `pl-`, `ev-`, `nt-`, `tk-`, `proj-`, `area-`, `goal-`, `hab-`, `med-`, `art-`
- **"Me" convention**: `per-self` with `relation = self`. All edges from self use that slug.
- **Email and conversation collapse into `Artifact`** — `thread_id` property handles threading; `InReplyTo` edges for replies. No separate `Email` or `Conversation` types.
- **Habit completions are a `[Date]` array on the Habit** — no separate `HabitCompletion` node. Promote to a node only if per-completion notes become valuable.
- **Cadence as a single `cadence_days` field** on `Person` — desired contact frequency. Drives "stale close friends" queries. No 3-axis priority — overkill for most lives.
- **Health, finance, hobbies** live as `Area` nodes with `Note`s attached — not their own node types. Domain-specific cookbooks (e.g. a health-intel one) can extend later.
- **Chunk + embedding** stays for semantic search. Population is a separate ingest, not in the static seed.

## Files

- `schema.pg` — Executable Omnigraph schema (source of truth)
- `seed.md` / `seed.jsonl` — Reference seed (human-readable / loadable)
- `queries/*.gq` — Read queries (8 files) + mutations (`mutations.gq`)
- `cluster.yaml` — Deployment declaration (graph `brain`, schema, stored queries)
- `omnigraph-config.example.yaml` — Example operator config: merge its `aliases:` into your per-user `~/.omnigraph/config.yaml`

## Quick Start

This cookbook is a **filesystem-backed cluster directory** — no object store,
no credentials. `cluster.yaml` declares the graph (`brain`), its schema, and
all stored queries; `omnigraph cluster apply` converges it (creating the graph
at `graphs/brain.omni`); the server serves the applied state. All commands run
from `second-brain/`:

```bash
cd second-brain
omnigraph cluster import --config .   # one-time: create the state ledger
omnigraph cluster plan   --config .
omnigraph cluster apply  --config .   # creates graphs/brain.omni, applies schema, publishes queries
omnigraph load --data seed.jsonl --mode overwrite graphs/brain.omni   # one-time seed
omnigraph-server --cluster . --bind 127.0.0.1:8080 --unauthenticated  # serve (local dev)
```

Then query through the server via aliases:

```bash
omnigraph alias close-friends
omnigraph alias person-recent-events per-theo
omnigraph alias tasks-i-owe
```

> Aliases come from `omnigraph-config.example.yaml` — merge into
> `~/.omnigraph/config.yaml` (or invoke a stored query directly: `omnigraph
> query <name> --graph brain [--params …]`). The per-user operator config is
> never committed; a `--cluster` server never reads it.

Day-2 changes are declarative: edit `schema.pg` / a `.gq` file / `cluster.yaml`,
then `cluster plan` (schema edits show real migration steps) → `cluster apply`
→ restart the server. Data still flows through `omnigraph load` / `omnigraph
mutate` against `graphs/brain.omni`. See the **omnigraph-best-practices** skill
for the full ops loop.

## Extending

This schema is the minimal core. Common extensions:

- **Strategy layer** — add `Belief` / `OpenQuestion` / `Decision` as first-class nodes (as in `pharma-intel/`) with `SupportsBelief` / `ContradictsBelief` / `InformsQuestion` edges from `Note` or `Artifact`. Turns this into a *thinking partner*, not just a data store.
- **Health cookbook** — a separate cookbook with full FHIR-grade `HealthRecord` / `Measurement` / `Condition` ontology. 
- **Communication style / writing tone** — a `WritingStyle` node per channel/audience for "draft a message in my voice."
- **Pattern emergence** — add a single `Theme` node + `NoteFormsTheme` edge if you want explicit emergent-theme tracking without going full SPIKE.

When in doubt, prefer extending in a sibling cookbook over bloating this one.
