# VC OS - A venture-capital operating system as a knowledge graph

Opinionated Omnigraph cookbook for venture-capital firms. Built on [Omnigraph](https://github.com/ModernRelay/omnigraph), shaped from a first-principles teardown of how a token-maxxing VC should work. Covers pipeline, diligence, decisions, portfolio, network, audit, and learning - all in one typed graph.

> For operating Omnigraph — schema authoring, queries, loading, branches, cluster ops, the CLI — see the **omnigraph** skill. This README covers only what's specific to VC OS. No object store needed — this is a filesystem-backed cluster.

## Why a graph, not another tool

A modern VC's stack typically contains 8–12 systems: a CRM (Affinity / Airtable ), a wiki (Notion), chat (Slack), a call-recording tool (Granola), spreadsheets and drives (Drive / Excel), portfolio modeling (Tactyc), an outbound platform (Lemlist), and per-firm bespoke hacks - a sightings / prospect databases enriched via Spectre/Harmonic, a third-party vector store for semantic search, local notes for firm memory, a cross-session memory daemon, a homegrown audit log.

Each store solved one problem at one moment. None of them talk to each other natively. Agents end up plumbing the gaps: brittle point-to-point integrations, slow queries and high token usage, scattered audit trail, no shared definitions. Adding automations makes the system more fragile rather than compouding.

With Omnigraph's native capabilities - typed schema + typed mutations, native blobs, hybrid search (vector + BM25 + RRF + FTS) in one runtime, git-style branches/commits, snapshot-pinned reads, policy-as-code - most of that per-firm bespoke storage collapses inward.

## From first principles

A firm is in the business of maintaining a **structured, dated, contradictable set of beliefs** about organizations, founders, and markets - and acting on them.

Every action either:
- **generates** a belief (scout finding, founder call, research brief)
- **updates** a belief (a new signal supports or contradicts an assumption)
- **acts on** a belief (decision, intro, board flag, follow-on)
- **records** the act (memo, log, comment)

The seven jobs a VC does - **Find, Evaluate, Decide, Win, Help, Monitor, Learn** - all collapse into one analytical loop over beliefs. The ontology is shaped to make that loop a 2-hop graph traversal.

## The schema - 7 core + 10 growth-ring

The core is the entities the team can hold in their head, stable for years even as the analytical layer above them compounds. The schema is organized accordingly.

### Core entities (7)

| Node | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **`Organization`** | Any real-world business entity |
| **`Person`** | An individual human. Roles live on edges, not on the node - `WorksAt org-quito` (team), `FounderOf co-x` (founder), `RoleInDeal {role: expert}` (expert). |
| **`Deal`** | A funding event involving an Organization. |
| **`Fund`** | The firm's funds. |
| **`Market`** | Sector/vertical hub. Sector-specialist Theses, Patterns, and Lessons cluster around it. |
| **`Artifact`** | Raw content with native `Blob` - Granola transcripts, pitch decks, emails, screenshots, chat messages, markdown wiki pages.  |
| **`Meeting`** | A scheduled (or ad-hoc) event with attendees, subject, and outputs. The transcript is an `Artifact`; the Meeting binds attendees + agenda + outcomes (Decisions, Commitments) around it. Covers IC, board, founder calls, partner offsites, pipeline reviews, expert calls. |

### Analytical layer

Built on top of the core. These can be added to or refined without touching the core.

| Layer | Nodes | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Belief | `Thesis` · `Assumption` · `Question` | The value layer (investing DNA). `Question` is the home for open uncertainties - not `Insight{kind=hypothesis}`. |
| Evidence | `Signal` · `Insight` · `Chunk` | What moves beliefs. `Chunk` is implementation detail for hybrid search. |
| Action | `Decision` · `Commitment` | What we do. `Decision` is one-shot (`decided_at`); `Commitment` is deferred-action with a deadline. Intros, follow-ups, *schedule-another-meeting*, and *flag-at-next-board* are `Commitment`s, not `Decision`s. |
| Reflexive | `Pattern` · `Lesson` | What we learn. `Pattern` aggregates across many subjects; `Insight` interprets one. `Lesson` is operational (changes future behavior); `Insight` is descriptive. |

**17 node types total** (`Chunk` should be populated via `omnigraph embed --reembed_all`). Source-provenance entities (TechCrunch, PitchBook, Tegus, anon blog) live as `Organization` rows with `kind` in `(publisher, database, expert-network)` and a `reliability` rating - no separate `SourceEntity` node.

Slug prefixes: `org- per- mkt- deal- fund- art- mtg- thesis- asmp- q- sig- ins- chk- dec- cmt- pat- lsn-`.

### The ontology at a glance

Every node type appears exactly once. Each row lists a node and where its outgoing edges go (with the edge verb in parens). Layers stacked from operational rules at the top to the engagement substrate at the bottom; flow between layers labelled on the connectors.

## Reference seed data - Fictional Series-A AI-infra fund

The seed populates a fictional Berlin-based AI-infra fund running Fund III ($250M, vintage 2024). Single coherent narrative; exercises all 16 populated node types (`Chunk` is schema-only). **All names, deals, organizations, and people are fabricated.**

| Layer | Count | Includes |
|---|---|---|
| Funds | 2 | Fund II (harvesting), Fund III (investing) |
| Theses | 8 | Vertical AI infra, on-prem inference, agentic CRMs, data-quality moats, etc. |
| Pipeline organizations | 12 | 6 in evaluation, 6 in pipeline |
| Portfolio organizations | 5 | Mix of Series A and B holdings |
| Markets | 6 | AI infra, AI applications, dev tools, vertical SaaS, security, data |
| People | ~25 | 5 team, ~10 founders, 4 LPs, 3 experts, 3 acquirer-DMs, plus 2 venture partners |
| Non-startup Companies | ~14 | Acquirers (hyperscalers, strategic), LP institutions, peer VCs, accelerators, plus 4 source orgs (TechCrunch / PitchBook / Tegus / anon blog) |
| Signals | ~30 | Mix of competitive, fundraise, portfolio-update, market-move |
| Decisions | 6 | invest, pass (×3), follow-on, thesis-level double-down (intros + follow-up actions are Commitments, not Decisions) |
| Patterns / Lessons | 5 / 4 | AI-infra-specific |
| Meetings | 8 | 2 ICs (Axon occurred, Helix upcoming), 2 Aetherbrick boards (Q1 occurred, Q2 upcoming), Helix founder call, Axon expert ref call, partner thesis-review offsite, weekly pipeline |

**Totals (loaded):** 207 nodes across 16 active types, 460 edges across 65 edge types. `Chunk` is schema-only (zero seeded). Bidirectional `Knows` accounts for 28 of those edges (14 unique pairs × 2).

## Example queries - with live output

The seed is shaped to light these up. Each is a single graph traversal that would otherwise require hand-stitching across 4+ systems. Output below is verbatim from `omnigraph alias <name> [args]` against the loaded seed.

> Aliases come from `omnigraph-config.example.yaml` — merge into `~/.omnigraph/config.yaml` (or invoke a stored query directly: `omnigraph query <name> --graph vcos [--params …]`).

org-techcrunch | TechCrunch          | medium        | Press releases + breaking news. Reliable on facts; commentary low signal.
```

**`source-downstream-signals org-techcrunch`** - if TechCrunch's reliability drops, these signals need revalidation:
```
sig.slug                  | sig.name                                   | sig.kind    | sig.date   | sig.impact

sig-microsoft-onprem-push | Microsoft expands Azure on-prem AI         | market-move | 2026-01-28 | normal
```

That walk - `Organization{reliability=low/medium} ← publishedByOrganization ← Artifact ← signalSourcedFromArtifact ← Signal` - is what justifies collapsing the old `SourceEntity` node into `Organization`. The provenance traversal is identical; one less node type to learn.

## How branches + commits replace audit + tentative-review

**Tentative Lessons - branch-based review.** An agent notices a recurring pattern in three closed deals → creates a `Lesson{kind=rule-of-thumb, status=tentative}` on a branch named `tentative/<date>`. Human reviews with `omnigraph branch diff`; merges if good, deletes if not. The branch *is* the review process.

**Decision counterfactuals.** A `Decision` committed to main is snapshot-pinned to the exact `Assumption`/`Signal`/`Question` state at the moment of decision. Six months later: "what would we have decided if we'd known X?" - branch from the decision's commit, mutate one Assumption, re-run the pre-IC brief query. The diff is the counterfactual.

## Example agent workflows

Five patterns the graph shape uniquely enables. The common shape: **agent proposes on a branch, partner reviews via `branch diff`, merges into `main`**. Each is invocable from `claude -p ...` (or any agent runtime) against the local omnigraph server.

For each agent below: the natural-language **prompt** you'd send it, concrete **pulls** (graph reads it makes) and **writes** (graph mutations it lands on a `tentative/…` branch). Only the first two also consume external data (a transcript or a scout note); the other three are pure graph composition.

### 1. Post-call ingestion · every 10 min (cron)

**Prompt:**
> Fetch new Granola transcripts since `sync-state.granola.last_synced_at`. For each: create the Artifact, resolve mentioned people/orgs (don't fabricate - flag unresolved), derive material Signals tied to the deal's existing Theses/Assumptions, extract action items as Commitments with assignee + due. One branch per meeting, `tentative/ingest-<meeting-slug>`. Update the cursor.

**External:** Granola REST.

**Pulls (per transcript):** the Meeting + attendees · the deal's thesis + grounding assumptions · the deal's open questions · prior similar Signals (so the new one is differentiated, not duplicate).

**Writes (per transcript, on its own branch):** the transcript as an Artifact (source `meeting-tool`, app `granola`) · 0–3 Signals each tied as `supports`/`contradicts` against the right Assumption · 0–N Commitments with assignee + `fromMeeting` back-edge + due-date.

**Why graph:** the Artifact, derived Signals, and extracted Commitments land as one atomic branch - a partial failure in one mutation rolls back the whole call's ingest, no orphan signals.

### 2. Scout-pick triage · daily 08:00 (cron)

**Prompt:**
> For each new external mention since yesterday's run (HN top launches, scout-list inbox, Twitter watches, founder DMs): triage per `Organization.status`. New → create on a tentative branch, enrich with market hub + links to relevant Patterns/Lessons + any open question this is data for. Resurface → tie to the prior pass Decision. Don't fabricate founder names. Respect the daily cap (Cedar policy on `add-signal{kind=discovery}`). Output: digest with one branch per pick.

**External:** HN launches feed · scout-list email inbox · Twitter `@`/keyword watches · founder DM channels.

**Pulls (per mention):** `search-organizations` for the dedup verdict · prior pass Decision if any name-match has `status=passed` · the firm's active Lessons + failure-mode Patterns in the candidate's Market · any open Question this mention is fresh evidence for.

**Writes (per genuinely-new pick, on `tentative/scout-<org>-<date>`):** Organization (`status=watching`, sector hub linked) · discovery Signal · the source mention as a provenance Artifact (`sourcedFromArtifact`) · `informsQuestion` to any live re-evaluation question · neutral Insight if a known anti-pattern matches, citing the Pattern.

**Why graph:** verdict is a structural property of `status` (no policy tree); prior-pass and accumulated lessons surface for free because they're already attached to the candidate's Market and Pattern.

### 3. Pre-X brief · calendar webhook 24h before any IC / board / founder call / 1:1

**Prompt:**
> A meeting is on the calendar in 24h. Look up its kind (IC / board / founder call / partner 1:1 / LP update) and subject (Deal / Org / Thesis / Person). Build the brief that fits: IC → thesis + supporting/contradicting evidence + open questions + bull/bear stances + prior meetings + outstanding commitments + a recommendation. Board → recent signals + open questions + commitments owed since last board + next board cadence. Founder call → person profile + intro path + relevant deals + prior conversations. Cite real evidence; end with the action recommendation the meeting type expects.

**External:** the calendar invite that triggered the webhook (kind + subject + attendees).

**Pulls (IC variant):** deal terms + lead partner · grounding Thesis + Assumptions with confidence · `supports/contradicts` Signals per Assumption (the asymmetry surfaces here) · open Questions by priority · existing bull/bear Insights and which Signals each cites · prior Meetings with attendee + summary · still-open Commitments with due dates.

**Writes:** None - output is the synthesized brief returned via the channel that triggered it.

**Why graph:** ~8 reads against one commit-pinned snapshot; re-runnable at the same commit ID six months later for counterfactual diligence reviews. Asymmetries like "bull defends demand pillar, bear attacks margin pillar" surface mechanically from counting which Assumptions each side's signals attack - not from clever synthesis.

### 4. Multi-agent IC simulation · calendar webhook 48h before a high-conviction IC

**Prompt** (one per agent - bull / bear / neutral fork):
> An IC is in 48h. You are the {bull | bear | neutral} agent. Read the deal's Thesis + Assumptions + recent Signals + related Patterns. Pick the evidence that genuinely supports your stance - overlap with the other agents is expected, that's the point. Write one `Insight{stance=…}` with `add-insight-with-stance` on the shared debate branch, citing Signals via `InsightReliesOnSignal` and any Pattern via `InsightHighlightsPattern`. Don't invent. Neutral agent: name what new evidence would resolve the disagreement.

**External:** the calendar invite for the IC.

**Pulls (each agent):** the Org / Deal / Thesis state · all Signals about the relevant Market · the Org's own recent Signals · the Patterns that aggregate this deal with others · existing Insights so framings aren't duplicated.

**Writes (one Insight per agent, all on a shared `tentative/ic-debate-<deal>` branch):** Insight with stance + summary + body · `InsightAboutDeal` · `InsightReliesOnSignal` per cited Signal · `InsightHighlightsPattern` if a market-shape Pattern is load-bearing.

**Why graph:** bull and bear linking the *same* Pattern with opposite framings makes the disagreement structurally legible. Partner can audit "are they arguing about different evidence, or interpreting the same evidence oppositely?" at a glance - not from re-reading two essays.

### 5. Reflexive learning sweep · quarterly (cron)

**Prompt:**
> Sweep the last quarter's Decisions, active Patterns, and existing Lessons. For any Pattern with ≥3 supporting Decisions and consistent outcome (all-pass / all-invest / all-write-off / all-double-down) that isn't already covered by an active Lesson, propose a tentative Lesson on its own branch, citing the Pattern and the Market it applies to. Output a digest: what landed, what was already covered, where evidence is too thin.

**External:** None.

**Pulls:** Decisions in the 90d window with outcomes · Patterns with their `acrossDecision` aggregations · active Lessons (`distilledFromPattern` already covering this?).

**Writes (only when a Pattern qualifies and isn't already covered):** `Lesson{status=tentative}` with body + `DistilledFromPattern` + `AppliesToMarket`.

**Why graph:** `Pattern.acrossDecision` aggregation makes "this shape recurred N times with consistent outcome" a deterministic query, not a vibes call. The duplicate-check against active Lessons is the same primitive - a sweep that always produces a Lesson would be a hallucinating sweep.

## v1 scope

**Ships:**
- Full 17-node schema with native `Blob` on `Artifact` and `Vector(3072) @embed("text")` on `Chunk`
- Reference seed: 207 nodes, 460 edges across 65 edge types, no embeddings, no blob payloads
- 294 aliases covering reads + mutations for every node/edge type (289 named queries across 12 `.gq` files)
- Example queries enumerated above

**Deferred (extensions, not blockers):**
- **Real blob + embedding examples in seed.** Schema declares the capability. Attach real PDFs/transcripts as `Artifact.blob`, populate `Chunk` rows, then `omnigraph embed --reembed_all` followed by hybrid queries combining `nearest()` / `bm25()` / `rrf()` with graph traversal.
- **Cedar policies** (`policies/`) - per-role access control (team / lp / read-only-portfolio) collapses application-layer permission code into the graph server.
- **Sector-specialist Pattern/Lesson packs.** AI-infra Patterns ship with the reference seed; talent-tech / climate / B2B-SaaS variants are sibling cookbooks.
- **`Measurement` node** for time-series KPIs/cash/runway (currently captured loosely via `Signal{kind=portfolio-update}`).

Total: 289 named queries, 294 aliases.

## Quick Start

This cookbook is a **filesystem-backed cluster** — no object store, no
credentials. `cluster.yaml` declares the graph (`vcos`), its schema, and all
stored queries; `omnigraph cluster apply` converges it (creating the graph at
`graphs/vcos.omni`); the server serves the applied state. All commands run
from `vc-os/`:

```bash
cd vc-os
omnigraph cluster import --config .   # one-time: create the state ledger
omnigraph cluster plan   --config .
omnigraph cluster apply  --config .   # creates graphs/vcos.omni, applies schema, publishes queries
omnigraph load --data seed.jsonl --mode overwrite graphs/vcos.omni   # one-time seed
omnigraph-server --cluster . --bind 127.0.0.1:8080 --unauthenticated  # serve (local dev)
```

Then query through the server via aliases (in a separate terminal):

```bash
omnigraph alias team
omnigraph alias founders-enriched
omnigraph alias pre-ic-brief-thesis      deal-helix-series-a
omnigraph alias signal-portfolio-impact  sig-vector-forge-aws-deal
omnigraph alias exit-landscape           org-pinion-infer
omnigraph alias debate-stances           deal-helix-series-a
omnigraph alias board-prep-pack          org-aetherbrick
omnigraph alias contradicted-active-theses
omnigraph alias intro-path-to-founder    per-helix-yuki
omnigraph alias reserve-pressure         fund-iii
omnigraph alias lessons-active
omnigraph alias publishers                                  # publisher/database/expert-network sources
omnigraph alias source-downstream-signals org-techcrunch    # downstream-signal revalidation
omnigraph alias person-insights          per-helix-yuki     # founder assessment
omnigraph alias observed-organizations                      # PitchBook-imported (no Quito engagement)
```

The aliases are also grouped by meeting view in `omnigraph-config.example.yaml` - `VIEW: IC Meeting`, `VIEW: Weekly Pipeline Meeting`, `VIEW: Portfolio Support Meeting`, `VIEW: LPAC / Fund Reporting` - so dashboards map 1:1 to alias bundles.

See the [Omnigraph](https://github.com/ModernRelay/omnigraph) repo for full CLI reference.

## Adapting for your firm

1. **Keep the schema as-is.** Most VC firms fit the 17-node ontology without modification.
2. **Replace the seed.** Use your firm's actual organizations, theses, people, and decisions. Start with current pipeline + portfolio; backfill history as time allows.
3. **Customize the `Market` taxonomy.** Sector-specialist firms (talent-tech, climate, fintech) only need to change `Market` enum-style values and the `Pattern`/`Lesson` content.
4. **Wire your existing tools as ingest sources.** Granola → `Artifact{kind=transcript, source=meeting-tool, source_app=granola}`. Slack → `Artifact{kind=chat-msg, source=chat, source_app=slack}`. Email → `Artifact{kind=email, source=email, source_app=gmail}`. The CRM gets fully replaced; everything else feeds in via mutations.
5. **Run the example queries against your real data.** If any returns empty, your seed is undermodeling the loop the query exercises - fix the seed, not the schema.

## Why this is the first "OS-grade" cookbook

Three properties no other cookbook in this repo delivers together:

1. **All seven workflow stages in one graph** - Find / Evaluate / Decide / Win / Help / Monitor / Learn.
2. **First-class engagement + action + reflexive layers.** `Deal`/`Fund`, `Decision`/`Commitment`, `Pattern`/`Lesson` share priority with `Signal`/`Insight` - they aren't bolted on.
3. **Stack collapse is the design principle.** Schema choices (native `Blob` on `Artifact`, hybrid search via `Chunk`, branch-as-audit, `Organization` as the universal entity-of-the-world) exist *specifically* to let the graph replace CRM + document store + learnings DB + audit log + access control + source-provenance registry.

The same pattern should generalize to other knowledge-work firms - law, consulting, family office, sales-led B2B sales operations.
