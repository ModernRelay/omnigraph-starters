Use this skill whenever a user wants to set up a new SPIKE graph — either with the existing AI industry demo data or for a new domain (biotech, fintech, crypto, geopolitics, macroeconomics, SaaS, climate tech, etc.). The flow presents a demo-vs-custom decision, then for custom setups elicits domain scope + actors + cadence + sources via structured multi-select (AskUserQuestion), adapts schema and enums for the target domain, runs initial web research to generate real seed content, and executes init + load. Apply aggressively when the user says any of: set up Omnigraph, bootstrap a new graph, create a new SPIKE starter, I want to track X industry, initialize intel for Y, new graph for Z domain, start a new context graph, or similar phrasing.

# SPIKE Starter Bootstrap

This skill takes a user from zero to a populated, queryable SPIKE graph. Two paths:

- **Demo** — use the existing `industry-intel` starter (AI/ML signals as of early 2026). Good for demos, exploration, and understanding what SPIKE looks like populated.
- **Custom** — set up a new domain (biotech, crypto, fintech, geopolitics, etc.). Takes ~30–60 minutes including initial research and user review.

**Prerequisites:**

1. RustFS running on `127.0.0.1:9000`. If not, bootstrap with:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ModernRelay/omnigraph/main/scripts/local-rustfs-bootstrap.sh | bash
   ```
2. The `omnigraph-starters` repo cloned somewhere on disk. Ask the user where (or default to the current directory):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ModernRelay/omnigraph-starters.git
   ```
   Record the absolute path to the clone — the **Demo** path runs from `<clone>/industry-intel/`, the **Custom** path runs from `<clone>/` (repo root) so it can copy `industry-intel/` as a template.

## Step 1: Ask the user which path

Use AskUserQuestion:

> Do you want to:
> - **Demo** — set up the AI industry intel demo (5 patterns, 15 signals, ~110 nodes, ready to query in ~30 seconds)
> - **Custom** — set up a graph for a new domain (I'll elicit your domain + sources, adapt the schema, research real seed data, and wire it up)

Branch based on the answer.

## Path A: Demo Setup

Quick — just clone, init, load.

See [`references/demo-setup.md`](references/demo-setup.md) for the full command list. Summary:

```bash
cd <path-to-clone>/omnigraph-starters/industry-intel
set -a && source ./.env.omni && set +a
# first time only: aws --endpoint-url http://127.0.0.1:9000 s3 mb s3://omnigraph-local
omnigraph init --schema ./schema.pg s3://omnigraph-local/repos/spike-intel
omnigraph load --data ./seed.jsonl --mode overwrite s3://omnigraph-local/repos/spike-intel
# Start the server (keep running), then query through it:
omnigraph-server --config ./omnigraph.yaml &
omnigraph read --config ./omnigraph.yaml --alias patterns disruption
```

After this, point the user at the `omnigraph-best-practices` skill for day-to-day operations.

## Path B: Custom Domain Setup

Six phases, in order. Don't skip ahead — each phase's output feeds the next.

### Phase 1 — Domain identification

Ask the user which domain they want to track. Use AskUserQuestion with these examples as options:

- Biotech
- Fintech
- Manufacturing
- Crypto / web3
- Geopolitics
- Other (user specifies)

Then narrow:
- Scope: "all of X" or "only Y within X"?
- Global or regional?

Capture a **project slug** for the new starter: `bio-intel`, `crypto-intel`, `geo-intel`, etc. This becomes the folder name and the repo prefix (`s3://omnigraph-local/repos/<slug>`).

### Phase 2 — Key questions (multi-select)

Use AskUserQuestion for each. See [`references/custom-domain.md`](references/custom-domain.md) for full phrasing and option lists.

- **Actors to track** (multi-select): companies, labs, regulators, individuals, protocols, investors
- **Time horizon**: recent only (3mo), medium (12mo), or full historical
- **Update cadence**: daily, weekly, monthly, ad-hoc
- **Primary consumer**: human analysts, internal dashboard, AI agents, mixed

### Phase 3 — Sources (most important)

Sources are the lifeblood of a SPIKE graph. The quality of the output is bounded by the quality of the sources. Spend time here.

Ask in order (see [`references/custom-domain.md`](references/custom-domain.md) for exact wording):

1. **Primary reading list** — newsletters, blogs, publications the user already reads (free-form, 5–15 entries)
2. **Priority analysts / experts** — 3–10 people whose takes should be first-class entities
3. **Regulatory / authoritative sources** — governmental, self-regulatory (FDA, SEC, IMF, etc.)
4. **Academic / primary sources** — journals, preprint servers, research aggregators
5. **Social / community** — X accounts, podcasts, forums

### Phase 4 — Confirm summary

Before making changes, echo what you captured back to the user:

- Domain + scope + project slug
- Actor types to track
- Horizon + cadence + consumer
- Source list (grouped by category)

Write this to `<slug>/setup-notes.md` in the new starter folder. Confirming now is cheap; rework later isn't.

### Phase 5 — Adapt the schema

From the **repo root** (`<clone>/`), copy `industry-intel/` as a template into `<slug>/`:

```bash
cd <clone>          # repo root, parent of industry-intel/
cp -r industry-intel <slug>
rm <slug>/seed.jsonl    # regenerated in Phase 6
```

Update in `<slug>/schema.pg`:

- `Element.kind` enum — replace with domain-appropriate kinds
- `Signal.domain` / `Element.domain` enum — replace with domain slices
- `Company.type` enum — match the ecosystem
- `SourceEntity.type` enum — match how sources publish
- `ArtifactType` enum — include domain-relevant formats
- Kind-specific Element properties (biotech wants `phase`, `moa`; crypto wants `chain`, `token_symbol`; etc.)

Update in `<slug>/omnigraph.yaml`:

- `graphs.local_s3.uri` → `s3://omnigraph-local/repos/<slug>`
- `project.name` → domain-appropriate name
- Optionally adjust aliases if query names change

**Pattern.kind** (`challenge`, `disruption`, `dynamic`) is usually domain-agnostic. Don't change it unless the user has strong reasons.

See [`references/schema-adaptation.md`](references/schema-adaptation.md) for the full keep-vs-change rules. See [`references/domain-examples.md`](references/domain-examples.md) for worked examples across biotech, crypto, fintech, geopolitics.

After editing:

```bash
cd <slug>
omnigraph query lint --schema ./schema.pg --query ./queries/signals.gq
```

Fix any lint errors before moving on.

### Phase 6 — Research, seed, init, load

Use web research to build real seed content. **Do not fabricate signals or dates.** See [`references/research.md`](references/research.md) for the workflow. High-level:

1. For each source from Phase 3, pull recent items (WebFetch / WebSearch)
2. Extract candidate signals (dated, URL-backed, specific)
3. Cluster into 3–5 patterns (recurring themes)
4. For each pattern, identify the Elements, Companies, Experts mentioned
5. Write `<slug>/seed.md` (tabular, human-readable) — **present this to the user for review before generating JSONL**
6. Generate `<slug>/seed.jsonl` from the confirmed seed.md
7. From `<clone>/<slug>/`, init, load, then start the server:

```bash
cd <clone>/<slug>
set -a && source ./.env.omni && set +a
omnigraph init --schema ./schema.pg s3://omnigraph-local/repos/<slug>
omnigraph load --data ./seed.jsonl --mode overwrite s3://omnigraph-local/repos/<slug>
omnigraph-server --config ./omnigraph.yaml &
```

8. Verify with a sample query (goes through the server):

```bash
omnigraph read --config ./omnigraph.yaml --alias patterns <pattern-kind>
```

### Phase 7 — Hand-off

Tell the user:

- What got created (starter folder, schema, seed counts, repo URI)
- How to query (via aliases or raw read)
- To use the `omnigraph-best-practices` skill for day-to-day ops (adding signals, schema evolution, branches)
